Graphical Computing Final project.

Planets and sun are not to real scale or distances. Rendering distance would need to be huge for that. Currently They are on Multiples of the actual distance.

C++ and GLSL are the main programming languages of this project.

## How to render

The following guide is for the Windows Operating System, using Visual Studio 2019 (Community Edition is fine). There are also a [Linux version](https://github.com/nunopenim/SolarSystemOpenGL-Linux), and a [macOS version](https://github.com/nunopenim/SolarSystemOpenGL-macOS) of the project.

Clone this repository via Visual Studio 2019. On the top bar make sure that you have selected "x86", if you use a x64 operating system. Then click on the "Local Windows Debugger" button. Some warning will appear, after a while a white window will also appear. Soon the stars can be seen. Use WASD to move and the mouse to look around :) Enjoy.

Note: It shouldn't needed to change the PATHs of the GLM, GLEW and GLFW libraries included, as they are using Variables. However if it fails, you can point to the right path. To do this, in Visual Studio's Solution Explorer, right click "solarSystem", go to Properties and check the C/C++ General Tab and the Linker Tab.

## Information

### Issues

For any issues with this, you can use the GitHub issues tab. I appreciate if you write [ISSUE] at beginning of the title, although this is not a strict requirement.

### Suggestions

Suggestions are always welcome, use the GitHub issues tab but write it as [SUGGESTION] in the title, so that I can separate what's urgent and what's not urgent.

### Contributions

Contributions are also welcome, be it in a text idea, which I consider a suggestion (view above!), or via code itself. For the latter, you can fork the repo, do your changes and then perform a pull request. I will analyse what you did, and I decide what makes to the main project or not. Although this project is no longer under active development, it never is finished.

### Using this project

The project is licensed under the DBADPL-B (Don't Be A Dick Public License B) . It means you can use it for whatever you want, the way you want, however if little or no changes were made, I appreciate credits.

Using it for educational or demonstration purposes is welcome and more than allowed (actually a bit flattering too!). So feel free to use it.

If however you use this for any commercial purpose and get rich out of it, I would appreciate a beer or a pizza too, as it is explained in the license file. Thanks for understanding and enjoy the project!
